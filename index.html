    <p id="tribute-info"><br><br><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jackson" target="_blank" id="tribute-link">Michael Joseph Jackson</b></a> (August 29, 1958 â€“ June 25, 2009)  also known as the <i>King of Pop</i> or by his initials MJ, was an American singer, dancer, musician, music producer, writer, entertainer, singer-songwriter, choreographer, record producer, recording artist, poet, arranger, businessman, humanitarian, philanthropist, and actor. He is recognized as the most successful entertainer of all time by Guinness World Records, as well as one of the most influential. His contribution to music, dance, and fashion (as well as a much-publicized personal life) made him a global figure in popular culture for over 4 decades.<br><br>
      The eighth child of the Jackson family, Michael made his professional debut in 1964 with his elder brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon as a member of the Jackson 5. He began his solo career in 1971 while at Motown Records. In the early 1980s, Jackson became a dominant figure in popular music. His music videos, including those of <i>"Beat It"</i>, <i>"Billie Jean"</i>, and <i>"Thriller"</i> from his 1982 album Thriller, are credited with breaking racial barriers and transforming the medium into an art form and promotional tool. The popularity of these videos helped bring the television channel MTV to fame. Jackson's 1987 album Bad spawned the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles <i>"I Just Can't Stop Loving You"</i>, <i>"Bad"</i>, <i>"The Way You Make Me Feel"</i>, <i>"Man in the Mirror"</i>, and <i>"Dirty Diana"</i>, becoming the first album to have five number-one singles in the nation. He continued to innovate with videos such as <i>"Black or White"</i> and <i>"Scream"</i> throughout the 1990s, and forged a reputation as a touring solo artist. Through stage and video performances, Jackson popularized a number of complicated dance techniques, such as the robot and the moonwalk, to which he gave the name. His distinctive sound and style has influenced numerous artists of various music genres.<br><br>
       While preparing for his comeback concert series, This Is It, Jackson died of acute propofol and benzodiazepine intoxication on June 25, 2009, after suffering from cardiac arrest.<br><br>
      According to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Jackson has been proclaimed <i>"The Most Awarded Entertainer of All Time," "The Biggest-selling Artist of All Time," "The Most Popular Artist in the History of Show Business,"</i> and <i>"The World's Most Famous Man."</i>
